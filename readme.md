# Repository Overview

In this repository, I will implement algorithms that will serve as **modular building blocks** for easy reuse in various projects. I am using the **Python** programming language because its clear and simple syntax makes it close to pseudocode, allowing for quick understanding of the algorithm's logic.

## Goals

My goal is to optimize the algorithms as much as possible while minimizing the use of "too powerful" or "specific" Python tools to facilitate their translation into stricter and less flexible programming languages. For example, I try to avoid using methods like `append` and `remove` from Python lists whenever possible, preferring more generic alternatives. If their use is unavoidable, you can rely on my own data structure implementations designed to be more flexible and easy to adapt.

## Balancing Performance and Readability

I aim to find the right balance between **performance**, **readability**, and **modularity**. This way, these algorithms can be easily integrated into projects requiring lower-level languages or environments with limited resources.
